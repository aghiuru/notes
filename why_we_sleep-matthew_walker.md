# Why we sleep (Matthew Walker)
## Chapter 2: Caffeine, Jet Lag and Melatonin
### Circadian rhythm
* Our innate biological rhythm is not precisely twenty-four hours — circadian: circa, dia
* To find out our circadian rhythm, we measure our core body temperature over the course of a day
* The typical rhythm is:
  - noon: 36.85 degrees
  - 6pm: 37.15 degrees
  - 1am: 37 degrees
* Chronotypes:
  - morning types (40% of the population)
  - evening types (30%)
  - and the rest lie in between
* The chronotype is strongly determined by genetics — _how much, he doesn't say_
* Work scheduling is biased towards early start times

### Melatonin
* Melatonin helps regulate the timing of when sleep occurs by signaling darkness
* However, it does not generate sleep
* The typical melatonin cycle is:
  - noon: 8 pg/ml plasma
  - 6pm: 8, starts increasing
  - 4am: peaks at 40
  - 6am: back to 8

### Traveling
* For every day we are in a different timezone, we can only readjust by about one hour
* It's more difficult to acclimate to a new time zone when traveling eastward: we have to fall asleep earlier

### Adenosine, caffeine
* Whilst awake, adenosine is building up in the brain — he calls it sleep pressure
* Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors
* Caffeine has a half-life (time down to 50% of the drug concentration) of 5 to 7 hours
* The circadian rhythm and the adenosine signal are independent!
* Because of the circadian rhythm, during an all-nighter, there are moments when we feel more awake

### Test for checking if we're getting enough sleep
* After getting up in the morning, could we fall back asleep before 11am?
* Can we function optimally without caffeine before noon?

## Chapter 3: Defining and generating sleep
### Stages of the sleep cycle
* 90 minute cycles, 5 different stages:
  - Wake
  - REM
  - NREM Stage 1
  - NREM Stage 2
  - NREM Stage 3-4 (slow wave sleep)
* During REM (dream stage), we are completely paralysed, but our eyes move: these eye movements do not track the visual experience in dreams

## Chapter 6: The benefits of sleep for the brain
### Fact-based learning
* The hippocampus acts as a short-term reservoir for new memories
* Our learning capacity progressively decreases throughout the day
* A 90-minute siesta improves learning by 20% — the book is abounding in round numbers
* Sleep spindles happen during NREM Stage 2
* The more sleep spindles during sleep, the greater the restoration of the learning
* Seniors (60-80 years old) suffer a 40% deficit in terms of slepep spindles
* For fact-based learning, early-night sleep, rich in deep NREM, provides better memory retention than late-night, REM-rich sleep
* MRI scans show that sleep spindles "move" information from the back of the brain (hippocampus) to the front (neocortex)
* tDCS: transcranial direct current brain stimulation, shown to generate spindles and improve memory retention as much as 40% — but then he says "do not try this at home"?
* Targeted memory reactivation: if images shown that we are supposed to remember are accompanied by sounds, and then half of the sounds are played during NREM sleep, we experience a bias in recollection towards the items that were reactivated through sounds — how big of a bias?
* If we associate each word we are supposed to remember with a letter, R for "remember", or F for "forget", after NREM sleep, we experience a bias towards the words marked for remembering. Interestingly, the results stay the same even when we get paid to remember every word.

### Muscle memory
* Muscle memory resides in the brain
* If we try to learn to type a sequence on a keyboard, for instance, after an 8-hour sleep, we experience a 20% increase in speed and a 35% increase in accuracy
* Rather than transferring to long-term memory like in the case of fact-based learning, the motor memories had been shifted to brain circuits that operate below the level of consciousness
* The increases in speed and accuracy were directly related to the amount of NREM Stage 2 sleep, especially in the last 2 hours of a 8-hour sleep
* We see a spike in NREM Stage 2 sleep in infants as they transition from crawling to walking

## Chapter 7: Sleep deprivation and the brain
### Reaction time
* One of the main two culprits for drowsy-driving accidents (which account to more accidents than alcohol and drugs combined), apart from falling asleep at the wheel, is microsleep: a momentary lapse in concentration
* During a microsleep, our brain becomes blind to the outside world for a brief moment
* When tested for reaction time, the impairment caused by the lack of sleep shows linear growth
* After 4 hours of sleep for 6 nights, we are just as bad as if we had not slept for 24 hours straight. We get the same effect after 6 hours of sleep for 10 nights.

### We can't tell how sleep deprived we are
* We underestimate our degree of performance disability
* We need 4 nights of 8-hour sleep for the performance to get back to normal
* After being awake for 19 hours, we are as cognitively impaired as when legally drunk
* The recycle rate of a human being is 16 hours. After 16 hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail.
* After 10 days of 7 hours of sleep, the brain is as dysfunctional as after an all-nighter — it was 6 hours the previous chapter?
* Sleep apnea (associated by being overweight) causes chronic sleep deprivation
* If we notice ourselves drowsy:
  - we pull off the road and take a brief nap (20-30 minutes)
  - we do not start driving immediately after waking up, we will be suffering from sleep inertia
  - wait for another 20-30 minutes

### Emotional irrationality
* The amygdala shows well over 60% amplification in emotional reactivity after an all-nighter
* Insufficient sleep does not push the brain into a negative mood, but creates the conditions for excessive swings to both extremes, positive and negative
* Sleep disturbance is a recognized hallmark associated with addictive substance abuse
* When sleep deprived, we can show similar brain activity patterns to brains affected by psychiatric illnesses

* If you don't sleep the very first night after learning, you lose the chance to consolidate memories, even if you get lots of "catch-up" sleep thereafter.

### Sleep and Alzheimer's disease
* A lack of sleep is fast becoming recognized as a key lifestyle factor determining whether or not we will develop Alzheimer's disease
* Alzheimer's disease is associated with the build-up of a toxic form of protein called beta-amyloid
* Beta-amyloid aggregates in sticky clumps within the brain, killing the surrounding brain cells
* The more amyloid deposits in the middle regions of the frontal lobe, the more impaired the deep-sleep quality is, thus preventing memory retrieval from the hippocampus
* The glial cells of the brain are shrinking in size by up to 60% during NREM sleep, allowing the cerebrospinal fluid to proficiently clean out the amyloid protein
* Wakefulness is low-level brain damage

## Chapter 8: Sleep deprivation and the body
* One night of modest sleep reduction (even just 1-2 hours) will promptly speed the contracting rate of a person's heart, and significantly increase the systolic blood pressure
* A lack of sleep further erodes the fabric of the coronary arteries
* If we sleep 5-6 hours a night or less, we are 2-3 times more likely to suffer calcification of our coronary arteries over the next 5 years
* Growth hormone is shut down by the state of sleep deprivation
* In the autumn when the clocks move back and we gain an hour of sleep, rates of heart attack plummet the day after. Unfortunately, the reverse is also true: the loss of an hour of sleep opportunity leads to a frightening spike in heart attacks the next day.
* When given just 5.5 hours of sleep opportunity, more than 70% of the weight loss comes from muscle
* Sleeping 5 hours for 7 days ages men hormonally by 10 years
* Women working erratic hours are 80% more likely to suffer from issues of sub-fertility
* Test: measured sleep of a group of a 150 healthy people, then after a week were given a shot the common cold virus — 5.5 hours of sleep lead to 50% infection, 7 hours of more, just 18%
* Sleep impacts our response to the standard flu vaccine. Those who slept 7-9 hours or more during the week prior to the flu shot, generated a powerful antibody reaction. Even 2-3 weeks of recovery sleep can't build the full immune reaction to the flu shot.
* A single night of four hours of sleep swept away 70% of the natural killer cells, relative to 8 hours
* WHO has officially classified nighttime shift as a "potential carcinogen"

## Chapter 9: REM-Sleep Dreaming
* Parts of the brain that light up during REM sleep:
  - the visual perception
  - the motor cortex, which instigates movement
  - the hippocampus and surrounding regions, which support your autobiographical memory
  - the deep emotional centres of the brain — 30% more active than when we are awake!
* Deactivation of the prefrontal cortex
* We can predict the form of someone's dream: visual, motoric, emotional
* Same patterns of activation to stimuli as when we are awake — thus, by studying someone's brain when awake, we could predict the contents of their dreams

## Chapter 10: Dreaming as Overnight Therapy
* First function of dreaming involves nursing our emotional and mental health
* The second is problem solving and creativity
* Noradrenaline (norepinephrine, is the brain equivalent of adrenaline) is not produced while dreaming
* The emotion-specific memory access takes places in a brain free of this stress chemical
* We can learn and usefully recall life events without being crippled by the emotional baggage that does painful experiences originally carried
* Test: two groups of participants are shown emotional images twice with a 12 hour break, one group sleeps in between showings. The sleep group showed a large and significant reduction in the activity in the amygdala.
* For curing the depression, it was only those patients who have expressly dreaming about the painful experiences around the time of the events who went on to gain clinical resolution from their despair
* The drug prazosin which is usually prescribed simply to lower blood pressure also has also the side effect of suppressing noradrenaline in the brain, thus helping the PTSD patients to restore healthier quality REM sleep
* When we are sleep deprived we tend to sleep into the default of fear bias, believing even gentle or somewhat friendly looking faces as menacing
* This REM sleep recalibration service comes into its own just prior to the transition to adolescence

## Chapter 11: Dream creativity
* Chemical properties of sleep willing after we wake up linger, creating an inertia that separates wakefulness from sleep and lasts some minutes
* We are 15 to 35% more creative when you emerging REM sleep compared with the awakenings from NREM sleep
* When you wake brain from and NREM or measure performance during the day, the operating principles of the brain are closely and logical connected — however wake the brain up from REM sleep and the operating algorithm is completely different
* REM sleep is capable of creating abstract knowledge and out of sets of information
* 18 month old babies have been shown to reduce high level grammatical structure from novel languages they hear but only after they have slept following the initial exposure
* We believe REM sleep plays a critical role in the development of language

## 12 tips for healthy sleep
1. Stick to a sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. As creatures of habit, people have a hard time adjusting to changes in sleep patterns.
2. Try to exercise on most days but not later than two or three hours before your bedtime.
3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine.
4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed.
5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night.
6. Avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep.
7. Don't take naps after 3pm.
8. Relapse before bed, don't overschedule your day.
9. Take a hot bath before bed.
10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom.
11. Wake up with the sun we'll use very bright lights in the morning. You should get an hour of exposure to morning sunlight and turn down the lights before bedtime.
12. Don't lie in bed awake. The anxiety of not being able to sleep can make it harder to fall asleep.
